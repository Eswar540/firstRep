Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of hundreds of
 billions of stars in the Milky Way, which is one of a few hundred billion galaxies in the universe.
 Many of the stars in a galaxy have planets. At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and
 the same in all directions, meaning that the universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales,
 galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space,
 creating a vast foam-like structure.[14] Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the
 niverse had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then[15] at an increasing rate.
